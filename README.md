# AutoMarket

AutoMarket is an educational programming game built with **Godot**, designed to teach programming logic through the automation of a supermarket.

Instead of solving isolated exercises, the player writes code that interacts directly with the game world: serving customers, managing stock, calculating change and automating increasingly complex tasks.

One of the project's main technical features is a **custom programming language interpreter implemented from scratch in GDScript** and integrated into the game's runtime.

## Highlights

- Educational game focused on programming logic and problem solving
- Custom programming language integrated into the gameplay
- Lexer, parser, AST and runtime/executor implemented in GDScript
- Support for variables, expressions, conditionals and loops
- Functions, recursion and control flow
- Arrays and game-specific built-in functions
- Stock, customer, transaction, sensor and upgrade systems
- In-game code editor and terminal
- Save system and progression mechanics
- Web export support

## Custom Interpreter

The game includes its own interpreter so player-written code can control systems inside the game.

The execution pipeline follows the general structure:

```text
Source Code
    ↓
  Lexer
    ↓
 Tokens
    ↓
  Parser
    ↓
   AST
    ↓
 Executor / Runtime
    ↓
 Game Systems
```

The interpreter supports programming concepts such as:

- variable declarations
- arithmetic and logical expressions
- `if` / `else`
- `while` and `for` loops
- functions and function calls
- recursion
- `return`
- `break` and `continue`
- arrays
- strings and booleans
- custom built-ins connected to the game

This allows the programming challenges to be part of the actual game simulation rather than a separate exercise screen.

## Architecture

The project is divided into systems with separate responsibilities.

```text

├── autoload/       # Global managers and shared state
├── interpreter/    # Programming language implementation
├── systems/        # Gameplay systems

├── tests/          # Interpreter and system tests
├── docs/           # Project documentation
└── assets/         # Visual and UI assets
```

Some of the main game systems include:

- `InterpreterSystem`
- `StockSystem`
- `TransactionManager`
- `SensorSystem`
- `UpgradeManager`
- `ChallengeSystem`
- `DeliverySystem`

These systems communicate with the game while keeping the interpreter separated from most gameplay logic.

## Technologies

- **Godot 4.7**
- **GDScript**
- Git / GitHub
- Custom lexer and parser
- Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- Custom runtime / interpreter

## Why I built it

AutoMarket started as an educational game project and evolved into an exploration of language implementation, software architecture and game systems.

The main challenge has been designing a programming environment that is simple enough for learning while still allowing increasingly complex algorithms and keeping execution synchronized with the game.

## Status

The project is under active development.

Current work includes expanding the programming language, increasing the complexity of the challenges and improving the in-game code editor to provide an experience closer to a real IDE.

## Running the project

1. Install a compatible version of Godot 4.
2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FaellEmiliano/AutoMarket.git
```

3. Open `project.godot` in Godot.
4. Run the project.
